# Analysis of covid-19 cases in NYC boroughs

As part of my Computational Math and Stats midterm project 
I wanted to understand the impact of covid-19 cases among 
NYC zip codes and the association with economic and 
demographic indicators. Steps of my analysis below:

##1. Collected information from different data sources
- NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH): number of people tested, positive cases and corresponding ratio per zip code.
- US Zip code databases: population and density per zip code (as of 2016)
- US Census and Bureau reports: mean and median population income per zip code (as of 2016).
